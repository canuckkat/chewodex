# Ingredients

* 1 ½ pounds chicken tenders, cubed
* 1 ½ cups chicken broth
* 1 ½ cups diced carrots
* 1 ½ cups diced celery
* 1 cup corn kernels
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
* ½ teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 cup heavy cream
* ½ cup frozen peas

# Directions

1. Combine chicken, broth, carrots, celery, corn, onion, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, poultry seasoning, and thyme in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot&reg;). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.

2. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 10 minutes more. Unlock and remove lid.

3. Stir in cream and peas. Select Saute function. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
