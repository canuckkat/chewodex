1. Most important used dried soaked chickpeas. Do not use canned or cooked chickpeas for this recipe.

2. Pat dry all ingredients before adding to the food processor as if the mixture is too wet the falafel has a tendency to fall apart. If the mixture is too wet then add a little.

3. You want a coarse mixture not a paste so do not over pulse the mixture.

4. Refrigerate and allow the mixture to rest for atleast 1 hour before shaping it.

5. Add baking powder to the mixture and mix well before shaping the mixture. This helps keep the Falafel airy and fluffy.
