## Equipment
- [ ] pot

## Ingredients
- [ ] 6 oz (170g) elbow macaroni
- [ ] salt
- [ ] 6 oz (180ml) evaporated milk
- [ ] 6 oz (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruy√®re, or Jack

## Instructions
1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.

2. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.

## Note
If you are willing to kick the total ingredients up to more than three, try a good dash of hot sauce, some mustard powder, or a little knob of butter stirred in with the evaporated milk.
