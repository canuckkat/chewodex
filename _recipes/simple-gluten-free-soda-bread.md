# Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose commercial gluten-free flour mix
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 ¼ cups full cream plain yogurt or sour milk
* 2 cups water <mark>FOR THE POT</mark>

# Instructions

1. Pour the water into the Instant Pot

2. Prepare your loaf pan and mix all the dry ingredients together. Mix in the yogurt and olive oil. Knead together gently until everything is combined then press the dough into the loaf pan.

3. Flatten the top then put the loaf pan on the trivet. Seal the lid as before. There is no need to rise this loaf as there is no yeast. Cook at high pressure for 20-25 minutes.

4. Allow the cooker to naturally release the pressure before removing the loaf. Bread internal temporature should be around 180-190&deg;F.

5. Brown the top if you like either in the oven or with the air fryer lid at 400&deg;F for 10-20 minutes. Cool the loaf out onto a wire rack.
