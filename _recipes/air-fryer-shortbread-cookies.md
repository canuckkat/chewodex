## Equipment
- [ ] Hand mixer
- [ ] Mixing bowl
- [ ] Cling wrap
- [ ] Air fryer
- [ ] Foil (recommended) or parchment: Cut the foil or parchment to be smaller at the basket giving about 2 inches at the edges, this way air and heat can still circulate.
- [ ] Cookie lifter / spatula (highly recommended)

## Ingredients
- [ ] 6 Tbsp salted butter
- [ ] ¼ cup powdered sugar
- [ ] ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp all purpose flour (you can use gluten free flour that measures 1:1 with flour)

## Instructions
1. Cream butter and sugar till light and fluffy.

2. Add flour and mix to combine. The dough would be crumbly, do not over mix. Use your hands to bring the dough together to form a ball.

3. Roll dough into a log. Wrap tightly in cling film and refrigerate for 30 mins or up 2hrs if you are not in a hurry.

4. When ready to bake, get the dough from the fridge, unwrap the dough and slice into ½ inch round discs.

5. Line air fryer basket with non perforated parchment paper making sure there is atleast 2 inches of room round to ensure proper heat and air circulation.
