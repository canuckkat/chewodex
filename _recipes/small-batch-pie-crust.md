## Equipment
- [ ] teaspoon (tsp) measuring spoon
- [ ] tablespoon (Tbsp) measuring spoon

## Ingredients
### For a Single pie crust:
- [ ] 1/3 cup flour
- [ ] 1 tsp sugar
- [ ] pinch salt
- [ ] 1 Tbsp shortening
- [ ] 2 Tbsp unsalted butter (chilled and cubed)
- [ ] 1 1/2 Tbsp ice water

### For a Double pie crust:
- [ ] 3/4 cup flour
- [ ] 2 tsps sugar
- [ ] 1/8 tsp salt
- [ ] 2 Tbsp + 2 teaspoons shortening
- [ ] 4 Tbsp unsalted butter (chilled and cubed)
- [ ] 3 Tbsp ice water

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.

2. Scatter the shortening over the flour mixture and using a fork incorporate the shortening. The mixture will resemble coarse sand.

3. Add the chilled butter cubes over the course flour mixture. Use a fork to incorporate the butter.

4. Sprinkle ice water over the dough half a tablespoon at a time. Press the dough together with a fork after each water addition. Stop adding water once the dough has come together.

5. Then flatten the dough and shape it into a disk (for a double crust divide evenly into two pieces first). Wrap the dough disk tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate them for at least 1 hour.

6. When you're ready to use the dough, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit for approximately 10 minutes, so that it softens and is easier to roll out.

### To pre-bake a single pie crust:
1. Roll out the pie crust on a floured surface and place it in a 6 inch pie pan. Click here for a 6 inch pie pan.

2. Prick the crust (in the pan) all over with a fork and then freeze it for 15 minutes before baking; it rarely puffs at all, and the holes pretty much fill themselves in the baking process so there's no leakage of filling.

3. Bake the pie crust in a 425 degrees F (220 C) oven until the edges are brown and golden.

4. Allow 25 - 30 minutes for full baking or 15 - 20 minutes for partial baking.

### To bake a filled double pie crust:
1. Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack. Heat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 C).

2. Prepare the pie filling of your choice.

3. Roll out the double pie crust on a floured surface then place the bottom crust in a 6 inch pie pan. Click here for a 6 inch pie pan.

4. Pour the filling into the unbaked bottom crust.

5. Lay the top crust over the filling, then seal and crimp the edges of the crust using either your fingers or a fork.

6. Cut 4-5 vent holes in the top of the pie crust.

7. Brush the top crust with beaten egg, and then (for fruit filled or sweet pies) sprinkle a half tablespoon of sugar over the crust.

8. Carefully place the pie on the hot baking sheet in the oven then reduce the temperature to 425 degrees F (220 C). Bake at this temperature until the top crust is golden brown. This should take 20-25 minutes.

9. Once the top is golden brown, rotate the baking sheet, and turn the temperature down to 375 degrees F (190C). Bake another 30-35 minutes, until the top crust is a deep golden brown.

10. Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool a bit before serving.
