Makes 1 litre. Just double the ingredients to make 2 litres.

## Equipment
- [ ] Large 1.5 – 2 L jar with wide mouth, sterilised with hot water
- [ ] Rubber band or string

## Ingredients
- [ ] 3 teaspoons loose leaf green tea
- [ ] 1/3 cup of honey
- [ ] ½ to 1 cup of starter liquid (solution from previous batch of Jun)
- [ ] A Jun SCOBY

## Instructions
1. Make sweetened green tea with Green tea in 4 cups of boiling water. Steep for 5 minutes or until cool (about 90&deg;F) and then dissolve the honey.

2. Wait for sweetened tea to cool to room temperature (at least 80&deg;F or below) and strain into a large jar.

3. Add starter liquid and Jun SCOBY to the jar with the sweetened tea.

4. Place a clean cloth or paper towel over mouth of the jar and secure with rubber band or string.

5. Leave the Jar undisturbed for 3 – 7 days at room temperature (taste after day 3). Ideal range is 16 – 19°C.

6. Carefully remove the SCOBYs and ½ a cup of Jun tea from the top of the jar and reserve for your next batch of Jun. You will now have 2 SCOBYs but its best only use the newly formed.

7. One for the next batch. You can use this one to experiment with flavours or store in a SCOBY hotel as back up.

8. Pour the remaining Jun tea into glass bottles, seal tightly and allow to second ferment for 2 – 3 days and then transfer to the fridge. Your Jun tea is now ready to drink.
