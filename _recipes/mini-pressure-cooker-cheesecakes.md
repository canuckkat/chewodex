- [ ] 1-6 Tbsp melted butter
- [ ] 3 Tbsp sugar (optional)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp cinnamon (optional)

- [ ] 8-16 oz. cream cheese completely room temperature
- [ ] ½-⅔ c sugar
- [ ] 1 tsp - 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- [ ] 2 eggs completely room temperature
- [ ] 1 Tbsp lemon juice (optional) -- use either this or below
- [ ] 2 tsp corn starch (optional)
- [ ] ¼ cup sour cream (optional)
### Optional Cherry Topping
- [ ] ½ c canned pitted cherries
- [ ] ½ c cherry juice from canned cherries
- [ ] ½ c sugar
- [ ] 2 ½ Tbsp flour
- [ ] ⅛ Tbsp salt
- [ ] 2 Tbsp butter

## Instructions
### How to make graham cracker crust
For crust, combine all ingredients and press into bottoms of ramekins (I used six 3 ½" ramekins). I put about ¼ heaping cupful in my ramekins, and it used just about all the crust topping. (6- ¼ servings)

### Cheesecake Filling Instrctions
1. For cheesecake, beat cream cheese with electric mixer. Add remaining ingredients, eggs last.

2. Beat just until combined. Place 1 cup of water in bottom of pressure cooker. Layer ramekins with tray or trivet. Set high 3 minutes, NATURAL RELEASE.

3. Let cool to room temperature, then chill in fridge for about 3 hours. Top with your favorite toppings!!

### Optional Cherry Topping
1. Make cherry topping by simmering cherry juice with sugar, flour, and salt. Whisk until flour is completely incorporated, simmer 1-2 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat, add butter, mix until melted. Add cherries to mixture. Refrigerate until cool.

2. When cheesecakes are done, let the cooker naturally release the pressure. When lid is not locked and all the pressure is released, remove lid and carefully remove ramekins from cooker with sturdy tongs.

## Notes
- These can be baked in the oven at 350&deg;F. Remove from oven after about 15 minutes, or once the edges have puffed up.

- Add more cooking time if you are using larger baking dishes and have a thicker cheesecake layer.

- Always natural release the cheesecake.

- Use any toppings! see posts for ideas and links!
