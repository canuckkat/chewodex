## Equipment
- [ ] medium bowl
- [ ] large saucepan
- [ ] slotted spoon

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 c. rice flour
- [ ] 1 c. cornstarch
- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp. salt
- [ ] pinch cayenne pepper
- [ ] 1/2 c. club soda (perhaps more to adjust the batter)
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 1 lb. cold cheese curds
- [ ] high heat peanut or safflower oil

## Instructions
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together rice flour, cornstarch, salt, cayenne, club soda, and egg until smooth. Let sit for 15 minutes. Whisk again before continuing.

2. In a large saucepan, heat 3 inches of oil over medium-high heat. When oil is hot enough for batter to sizzle, add half the cheese curds to the batter and stir around. Fry cheese curds a few at a time until brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Continue adding curds to the batter until all the curds are fried. Serve hot.
