## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 1 tsp sugar
- [ ] ½ tsp salt
- [ ] 3 Tbsp salted butter , cold, cut into ¼-inch pieces
- [ ] ½ cup milk

## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.

3. Toss butter into the dry ingredients. Working quickly using your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it resembles coarse sand.

4. Add the milk and stir just until the dough comes together.

5. Using a large spoon, drop spoonfuls of the batter onto baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 10-12 minutes.

## Notes
### Expert Tips
The secret to excellent biscuits is cold butter. It's true, room temperature butter is not what you want.

When making biscuits, you want it cold because the butter creates steam as it melts in a hot oven. The steam from the melting butter expands between the layers of dough. This creates pockets of air which will give you a flaky biscuit.
