# Ingredients

- [ ] 1/3 lb ground beef
- [ ] 1 large onion, chopped
- [ ] 2/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- [ ] 1/3 cup salsa
- [ ] 3 Tbsp canned chopped green chiles
- [ ] ¼ tsp garlic powder
- [ ] ¼ tsp hot pepper sauce
- [ ] 1/8 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/8 tsp ground cumin
- [ ] 1 tube (8 oz) refrigerated crescent rolls
- [ ] Optional: Shredded lettuce, sliced ripe olives, chopped tomatoes and sliced seeded jalapeno pepper

# Directions

1. Preheat air fryer to 300°. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; crumble meat; drain. Stir in cheese, salsa, chiles, garlic powder, hot pepper sauce, salt and cumin.

2. Unroll crescent roll dough and separate into 4 rectangles; press perforations to seal. Place 1/2 cup meat mixture in the center of each rectangle. Bring 4 corners to the center and twist; pinch to seal. In batches, place in a single layer on greased tray in air-fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, 18-22 minutes. If desired, serve with toppings of your choice.
