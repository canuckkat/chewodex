Based off [Instant Pot Meatloaf](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/instant-pot-meatloaf/) and [Easy 5 Ingredient Meatloaf](https://talkingmeals.com/easy-5-ingredient-meatloaf/).
## Equipment
- [ ] loaf pan
- [ ] mixing bowl

## Ingredients
- [ ] 16 oz/1 lb ground beef (or ground turkey, ground pork or a combination)
- [ ] 1 cup parmesan cheese, grated or 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
- [ ] 1/2 cup diced onion or 3 tsp dried minced onion
- [ ] 1 large egg
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp ground pepper
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic or 3/4 tsp garlic powder *(optional)*
- [ ] 1/2 tsp dried sage *(optional)*

### Meatloaf Sauce
- [ ] 1/4 cup ketchup for mixing with beef

OR

- [ ] 2 Tbsp ketcup
- [ ] 1 Tb Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 1 tsp dijon mustard

### Meatloaf Topping Sauce
- [ ] 1/3 cup ketchup for spreading on top of loaf

OR

- [ ] 1/2 cup ketchup
- [ ] 6 Tbsp light brown sugar
- [ ] 2 tsp dijon mustard
- [ ] 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg

### Mashed Potatoes
- [ ] 3 pounds quartered Yukon Gold Potatoes
- [ ] 1 cup water
- [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 cup milk
- [ ] Â¼ cup sour cream
- [ ] 3 Tbsp butter
- [ ] 1 tsp bouillon paste (I love 'Better than Bouillon)

## Instructions
### Oven
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a loaf pan with aluminum foil for easy removal of the meatloaf after it is cooked.

2. Finely dice the onion.

3. Mix all ingredients (except the 1/3 cup Ketchup reserved for the top) together in a large bowl with a fork or with hands: beef, parmesan cheese, onion, egg, ketchup, salt, pepper.

4. Form a loaf in the loaf pan.  Spread the remaining 1/3 cup Ketchup over the top of the meatloaf. Bake in the oven for 45 minutes.

5. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes.  Remove from the pan, cut and serve with roast or mashed potatoes or salad.  Enjoy!

### Instant Pot
1. Add all of the meatloaf ingredients to a large bowl and gently mix everything to combine (without over-working the meat).

2. Form the meat mixture into a round loaf that will fit into your instant pot.

3. Place the loaf on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold the edges up to make a secure nest for the meatloaf to rest in. (You want the edges high enough that grease from the loaf wont spill out onto the potatoes while cooking.)

4. Add the quartered potatoes, water, and salt to the bottom of the instant pot.

5. Lay the IP wire rack on top of the potatoes. Place the aluminum foil "nest" with the meatloaf on top of the rack.

6. Secure the lid on the pot and close the pressure release valve. Select manual/High pressure and cook at high pressure for 25 minutes*.  When the timer beeps, allow the pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes.

7. While the meatloaf cooks, make the sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl.

8. Remove the IP lid, and carefully remove the meatloaf. Discard the aluminum foil and drippings. Spoon the meatloaf sauce over the top and broil for 3 minutes. Cut into slices.

9. Add the milk, sour cream, butter, bouillon paste, and salt and pepper to the bottom of the instant pot with the mashed potatoes. Mash to combine (but don't over-mash the potatoes).  Taste and adjust seasonings, as needed.

## Recipe Notes
You can definitely substitute ground chicken or ground turkey.  The cooking time will be the same.  However, for poultry, you should check the internal temperature to ensure it reaches 165&deg;F. For beef, it should be 155&deg;F.
