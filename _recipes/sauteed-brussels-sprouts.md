# Ingredients

* 1 pound brussels sprouts trimmed and halved
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or lemon juice
* 1 to 2 tablespoons raw pine nuts or chopped raw walnuts, almonds, or pecans (optional)
* Chopped fresh herbs like parsley cilantro or mint (optional)
* A handful of Parmesan feta, or goat cheese (optional)

# Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy bottom skillet (a cast iron pan is a good choice), then add your Brussels sprouts. Cook undisturbed until caramelized.

2. Add spices and stir. Continue to cook and stir until the Brussels sprouts are deep dark golden brown.

3. Remove from the heat, and stir in the vinegar. Finish the sprouts off any way you like: a handful of Parmesan cheese, nuts, or herbs, or simply enjoy them just as the are. Serve hot and DIG IN!

## How to Trim Brussels Sprouts

Before trimming, I recommend washing your Brussels sprouts to remove any dirt.

**To Trim:** Use a knife to cut off the tough stem end of each Brussels sprout. Then, remove any yellow or damaged leaves, and cut each Brussels sprout in half lengthwise, from tip to trimmed end.

## Recipe Variations

* **Sautéed Brussels Sprouts with Bacon.** Dice 4 slices of bacon, and cook them in your skillet. Once crispy, remove to a plate. Then, cook your sprouts in the bacon drippings. Top your finished sprouts with the crispy bacon pieces. YUM!

* **Sautéed Brussels Sprouts with Herbs.** Add a tablespoon of fresh herbs to your sprouts at the end. I used parsley, but cilantro and mint would be delicious too.

* **Pan Fried Brussels Sprouts with Parmesan.** Toss a handful of Parmesan over the sprouts at the end. Feta and goat cheese are other, super tasty options.

* **Sautéed Brussels Sprouts with Onions.** Add ½ cup of thinly sliced onions to the pan with your Brussels sprouts. They’ll crisp and caramelize in a most excellent way.

* **Pan Sautéed Brussels Sprouts with Toasted Nuts.** Stir a handful of chopped, raw nuts into the pan with the Brussels sprouts at the very end. Continue stirring, allowing the residual heat from the pan to toast the nuts. For today’s recipe, I used pine nuts. Walnuts and pecans are two of our other favorites.

## How to Store, Reheat, and Freeze Sautéed Brussels Sprouts

* **TO STORE.** Place cooked Brussels sprouts in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.

* **TO REHEAT.** Gently rewarm leftovers in a large skillet on the stove over medium-low heat until warmed through, adding in a splash of balsamic vinegar to perk them back up. You can also microwave the Brussels sprouts on a microwave-safe plate until warm. Add fresh toppings as desired. My other favorite method is the oven: warm at 350 F until heated through (about 5 or so minutes).

* **TO FREEZE.** Brussels sprouts can become soggy, so I don’t recommend freezing them. However, you certainly can freeze them if you don’t mind the less-than-optimal texture. Place cooked and cooled Brussels sprouts in an airtight freezer-safe container and store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.
