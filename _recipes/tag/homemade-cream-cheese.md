## Ingredients

- [ ] 4 cups (32oz /1000ml) whole milk (full fat, not low fat)
- [ ] 2-3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (lime juice or white vinegar)
- [ ] ¼ - ½ teaspoon salt (read notes)

## Instructions (Stove Top)

1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the milk on med-high. Stirring constantly until it starts to a rolling simmer.

2. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the lemon juice 1 tablespoon at a time, in 1-minute intervals. Continue stirring constantly.

3. Continue cooking until the mixture curdles. Stir constantly till the mixture has separated completely, this should take just a few minutes. There will be a green liquid on the bottom and thick curdles on top. Remove from the heat. This should happen within a few minutes.

4. Lay a sieve with cheesecloth over a large bowl. Pour the curd mixture into the sieve. Let it strain and cool for about 15 minutes.

5. Transfer curds to a food processor and process until curds have come together and are totally smooth and creamy. It will take around 3-4 minutes. Keep going if your cream cheese is grainy.

6. Add salt and taste. Add more if you want more flavor. Now is also a good time to add herbs, garlic or any other flavors you like.

7. This cream cheese must be stored in the fridge. I always use it within 7 days but can last as long as up to 2 weeks.

## Instructions (Instant Pot)

1. Pour milk into Instant Pot and use "Yogurt - Boil" setting to boil the milk to a rolling simmer.

2. Switch to "Saute" and stir for 1 minute to ensure all of the milk proteins were fully denatured.

3. Bring it up to 190&deg;F and then switch to "Slow Cook". Add lemon juice 1 Tbsp at a time in 1-minute internvals. Stir constantly and continue cooking until the mixture curdles. Stir constantly till the mixture has separated completely, this should take just a few minutes. There will be a green liquid on the bottom and thick curdles on top. Remove from the heat. This should happen within a few minutes.

4. Lay a sieve with cheesecloth over a large bowl. Pour the curd mixture into the sieve. Let it strain and cool for about 15 minutes.

5. Transfer curds to a food processor and process or whip by hand until curds have come together and are totally smooth and creamy. It will take around 3-4 minutes. Keep going if your cream cheese is grainy.

6. Add salt and taste. Add more if you want more flavor. Now is also a good time to add herbs, garlic or any other flavors you like.

7. This cream cheese must be stored in the fridge. I always use it within 7 days but can last as long as up to 2 weeks.

## Notes
**Small Curds:** I have heard feedback that lemon juice yields a smaller amount of curd than vinegar, and this may very well be true for pasteurized milk. Choose a white vinegar, cider vinegar/white wine vinegar will do it. When using lemon juice use it fresh from the fruit.

**Salt:** Just add ¼ teaspoon of salt and then taste. If you would like it saltier then feel free to add more.
