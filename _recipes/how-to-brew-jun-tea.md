## Equipment
- [ ] 1 gallon kombucha brewing jar, small pot, breathable kombucha cloth cover, and a rubber band
- [ ] 1 funnel
- [ ] 1 thermometer or adhesive temperature strip
- [ ] 1-3 pH Strips
- [ ] 1-7 kombucha bottles – pressure holding, airtight bottles for the secondary fermentation, and storing your finished brew

## Ingredients
- [ ] 12-14 cups filtered water
- [ ] 6 bags green tea OR 6 tsp of loose leaf green tea
- [ ] 1 cup raw honey
- [ ] 1 jun kombucha SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) – pellicle with 12 fl oz (~1.5-2 cups) of jun starter tea


## Directions
1. Bring four cups of water to a boil, then remove the pot from heat.
2. Steep the tea for 10 minutes.
3. Allow tea to cool to below 90&deg;F. Add honey.
4. Pour sweetened tea into the glass brew jar and fill with filtered water, leaving enough room to add the culture, and some head space (about 4″).
5. The addition of the water should bring the tea mixture to about room temperature or below 80&deg;F. Just make sure it’s cool to the touch before moving on.
6. Add your Jun starter culture (pellicle with 12 fl oz or 1.5-2 cups of mature jun starter tea).
7. Cover the jar and leave it to ferment ideally between 75-78&deg;F. Start tasting after day 5 to asses the progress. If it is still too sweet, allow it to continue fermenting as the full fermentation can take up to 21 days.
