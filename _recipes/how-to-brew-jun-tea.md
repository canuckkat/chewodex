## Equipment
- [ ] 1 gallon kombucha brewing jar, small pot, breathable kombucha cloth cover, and a rubber band
- [ ] 1 funnel
- [ ] 1 thermometer or adhesive temperature strip
- [ ] 1-3 pH Strips
- [ ] 1-7 kombucha bottles ‚Äì pressure holding, airtight bottles for the secondary fermentation, and storing your finished brew

## Ingredients
- [ ] 12-14 cups filtered water
- [ ] 6 bags green tea OR 6 tsp of loose leaf green tea
- [ ] 1 cup raw honey
- [ ] 1 jun kombucha SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) ‚Äì pellicle with 12 fl oz (~1.5-2 cups) of jun starter tea


## Directions
1. Bring four cups of water to a boil, then remove the pot from heat.
2. Steep the tea for 10 minutes.
3. Allow tea to cool to below 90&deg;F. Add honey.
4. Pour sweetened tea into the glass brew jar and fill with filtered water, leaving enough room to add the culture, and some head space (about 4‚Ä≥).
5. The addition of the water should bring the tea mixture to about room temperature or below 80&deg;F. Just make sure it‚Äôs cool to the touch before moving on.
6. Add your Jun starter culture (pellicle with 12 fl oz or 1.5-2 cups of mature jun starter tea).
7. Cover the jar and leave it to ferment ideally between 75-78&deg;F. Start tasting after day 5 to asses the progress. If it is still too sweet, allow it to continue fermenting as the full fermentation can take up to 21 days.

## Notes
You'll want 1:6-8 starter to tea ratio.

Containers: 1 quart = 1L = 4 cups

## Second Ferment
Reserve what you need for the next batch of 1F (i.e. for 1qt container, you'll need to save 1/2 cup of starter).

For a 16 oz bottle (473ml), add 10-20% as flavouring including 3 or 4 oz (~100ml, 1/3-1/2 cup) of pineapple juice or pineapple.
