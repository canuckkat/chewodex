# Ingredients

- [ ] 8 egg roll wrappers *or spring roll wrappers*
- [ ] 1 Tbsp flour
- [ ] vegetable oil for brushing *or cooking spray*

## Filling
- [ ] 1 lb ground pork
- [ ] 1 Tbsp fresh ginger grated
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic minced
- [ ] 4 cups packaged fresh coleslaw or 4 cups finely chopped cabbage & shredded carrots
- [ ] 2 green onions sliced
- [ ] 2 Tbsp soy sauce

# Directions
1. Add pork to a medium skillet and cook until no pink remains. Drain any fat.

2. Stir in garlic and ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coleslaw and cook until tender, about 5-6 minutes.

3. Stir in soy sauce and green onions.

4. Mix 1 tablespoon flour with just enough water to make a paste.

5. Lay out egg roll wrappers and place about 1/3 cup filling in each. Fold diagonally, fold sides in and roll up sealing the tip with a little bit of the flour paste.

6. Brush the outside of each egg roll with a little bit of vegetable oil or spray with cooking spray.

7. Place in the air fryer basket 3-4 at a time and cook at 390Â°F for 8 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 3 minutes.
