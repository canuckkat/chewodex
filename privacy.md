## How We Process Your Data
This webite is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub.

### GitHub
View comments and commenting on a page is available via GitHub, which requires third-party cookies and scripts to be enabled.

### CDN
This website is using cloud-hosted jQuery and FontAwesome libraries, which you most likely already have cached thanks to the millions of websites using the same CDN libraries. They require you to allow (specific) third-party scripts.
